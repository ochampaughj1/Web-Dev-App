Gone. Everyone, except the kids trapped in the FAYZ - an invisible dome that was created by an alien virus. Inside the FAYZ, animals began to mutate and teens developed dangerous powers. the terrifying new world was plagued with hunger, lies, and fear of the unknown.

	Now, four years later, meteorites are hitting Earth with a virus that is even deadlier. Humans will mutate into monsters and the whole world will be exposed.

	But power corrupts. As some teens begin to morph into heroes, they will find that others become dangerously out of control and that the world is on the brink of a monstrous battle between good and evil.

	And there is only one thing more terrifying than the fear of the unknown: when history repeats itself.`,2e3,"./assets/images/monster.jpg",!1),Qi=new c(34,5,"Villain",324,`	It's been four years since the events of GONE. The Perdido Beach dome is down, but the horrors within have spread. The alien virus-infested rock that created the FAYZ is creating monsters - monsters that walk the cities and countryside, terrorizing all.

	There are tanks in the street and predator drones in the sky, doomed efforts to stop the disintegration of civilization. Into this chaos comes a villain with the power to control anyone with just the sound of his voice. Dillon Poe wanted to be a comedian once... but everyone made fun of him. Dillon the loser. Dillon the freak. Now he's sending thousands to their death. Who's laughing now?

	The only people who can stop a superpowered villain are superpowered heroes. Dekka, Shade, Cruz, Malik, Armo, and a new mutant with unmatched powers, are all that stand in Dillon's way. But when the lines begin to blur between hero and villain - some begin to wonder who's really the monster.`,2e3,"./assets/images/villain.jpg",!1),en=new c(35,5,"Hero",427,`	Monster. Villain. Hero.

	Four years after the Perdido Beach dome went down, the alien virus that created it is still wreaking havoc, and virus-infested rock has created a new set of humans with mutant powers.

	Rockborn gang members Dekka, Shade, Cruz, Malik, Armo, and Francis are fresh off their defeat of Dillon Poe and in need of answers to some very pressing questions about their own powers: who are the Dark Watchers? And what is this Fourth Dimension that only Francis can access?

	But heroes don't get down time. When the alien-virus infested rock hits New York, a new foe, Bob Markovic, rises amongst the newly rockborn. Markovic's arrogance and lack of a moral compass already made him unbearable. With his newfound power to inflict a deadly disease, he could send all of humanity into a living hell.

Two hundred and fifty years after World War III went nuclear, the surface of the planet is still uninhabitable. Devastating weapons left behind a barren, radioactive wasteland. Electrical storms block out the sun, and cities have been reclaimed by nature. No one remembers how the war started, or why, but the survivors living in the sky have seen the aftermath and know the truth - there's no returning to the surface any time soon.

The Airships

What remains of humankind exists on two massive flying airships: the Hive and Ares. The ships circle the globe, the crews tirelessly searching for areas to raid on the ground and holding out hope that someday they will find a habitable place to set down.
Betrayal and sacrifice in the skies...
On the Hive, there is tension among the lower decks, where the passengers face starvation and disease. A militia is tasked with keeping order, but growing unrest threatens the fragile peace.

The Hell Divers

They dive so humanity survives...
Hell Divers are the courageous few that accept the dangerous duty of sky diving to the surface, where they search for the parts essential to keeping their floating homes in the air. After diving twenty thousand feet through electrical storms, they face further danger as they navigate the deadly ruins of civilization, in order to save what's left of humanity and recover fuel so desperately needed by the airships.
